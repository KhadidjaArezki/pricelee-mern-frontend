# pricelee-mern-frontend

The frontend server for Pricelee.
Pricelee is a price tracking service. It allows you to search products from popular online stores and to create alerts for the products you want to track after you sign up. You can use filters to improve the search and get more specific results.

For the moment, pricelee only supports calls to the ebay api. It can search by keywords, category id, and price range.

After a user is authenticated, they can add alerts, edit and delete them. They can see the complete list of the alerts they created.

The backend is hosted at [https://pricelee-mern-frontend.herokuapp.com/](https://pricelee-mern-frontend.herokuapp.com/)
